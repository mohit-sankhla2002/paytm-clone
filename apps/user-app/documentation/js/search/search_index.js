src/app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.\nTo create API routes add an api/ directory to the app/ directory with a route.ts file. For individual endpoints, create a subfolder in the api directory, like api/hello/route.ts would map to http://localhost:3000/api/hello.\nLearn More\nTo learn more about Next.js, take a look at the
